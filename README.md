Project Title: JsonPowerDB Integration for project management

Description
This project demonstrates the integration of JsonPowerDB (JPDB) with [Your Project Name], showcasing how to leverage JPDB's RESTful APIs for managing and manipulating data. JsonPowerDB is a high-performance NoSQL database designed for modern web and mobile applications. It provides an easy-to-use JSON-based interface for interacting with databases and supports a variety of operations, including create, read, update, and delete (CRUD).

In this project, we utilize JsonPowerDB's capabilities to manage data in a COLLEGE-DB or SCHOOL-DB, depending on the scenario. The project includes a Student Enrollment Form, a Project Management Form, or any other example specific to your implementation.
